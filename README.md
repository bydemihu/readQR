### This is a custom Chrome extension for the UT BFA Design Class of 25's Senior Exhibition!
Designed and developed by Demi Hu as part of the Portfolio Showcase committee.

This extension is part of an interactive experience encouraging participants to collect QR cards from various student exhibitors, which they can then scan at portfolio kiosks around the space to display that student's portfolio website.
